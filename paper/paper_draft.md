# OCR on Indus Seals

## Abstract
Very serious and continuous attempts in deciphering the Indus Script of the Indus valley civilization has been carried out for years together, now, though many claim to have succeeded in deciphering it, there is still no standardized and universally accepted approach to it. All these years the humans have been employed in manually executing the process of decipherment, but, if the computers were able to read the indus script from the seals and other artifacts and recognize the symbols and the text sequences that they form, it will lead to a huge array of possibilities, that include, analysing the language, deciphering it and learning new additions to it, in an iterative way. For the computers to be able to read a new language, we present, in our work here, an Optical Character Recognition engine that is capable of reading the symbols of the Indus Script inscribed on the artifacts and be able to represent them in a computer readable format, say, a sequence of numbers in which each number corresponds to a symbol in the Indus Script according to the Mahadevan Corpus. With the advances in computer vision, image processing and deep learning, given images of Indus seals or other artifacts from the archaeological sites, our Optical Character Recognition engine tries to automatically locate text patches or regions from the images and further segment out the individual symbols from those regions. Once these symbols have been segmented out, we identify each symbol that belongs to the Indus Script and thus ultimately mining the symbol patterns that form the text. With these text sequences mined from the Indus Seal images and advanced machine learning techniques, we believe, to discover very interesting information and intriguing knowledge about the Indus Script and its semantics.

## Author Summary

## Introduction
The Indus valley civilization is the first major urban culture of South Asia, which was at its peak from 2600 BC to 1900 BC referred to as the Mature Harappan civilization. The Indus Script or the Harappan Script of the Indus valley civilization is referred to as a bronze age writing, which has still not been deciphered successfully, though many claim to have succeeded in it, all of their work claim, mutually exclusive statements and hence there is no universally accepted and standard decipherment till date. The reasons behind these failed attempts of decipherment are believed to be, because of the lack of bilingual text, inability to identify the underlying language and due the sparsely available script inscriptions. These Indus Scripts are extremely short inscriptions with an average length of 5 and maximum of 17 symbols per text inscription. They are usually inscribed on rectangular stamp seals and many other objects including tools, tablets, ornaments and pottery, made of many different materials such as soapstone, bone, shell, terracotta, sandstone, copper, silver and gold. According to Mahadevan corpus [] from the 3700 discovered seals, 417 signs have been found in specific patterns. Given these challenges to deciphering such an ancient language, which was for long, even being doubted if they constituted a writing system, that was later proved otherwise by showing that these languages have a syntactic structure like any other normal language such as English, based on statistical analysis[].
